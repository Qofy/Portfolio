    <p>
      I'm a motivated and self-driven Software Engineering student with a strong academic foundation and a deep passion for frontend engineering, user experience, and clean design. From crafting visually engaging interfaces to optimizing performance and accessibility, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and logic.
      <br /><br />
      With hands-on experience building responsive, user-centric web applications using TypeScript, React, and modern frontend tooling, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that delivers real value. My projects span from interactive voting platforms and task dashboards to CMS-driven websites and UI/UX prototypes built in Figma.
      <br /><br />
      I actively seek out new technologies, follow agile workflows, and contribute to collaborative development environments. Whether working solo or as part of a distributed team, I take full ownership of my features—from ideation to deployment.
      <br /><br />
      What drives me is more than code—it's solving meaningful problems, building intuitive digital experiences, and continuously learning to become a better engineer every day.
